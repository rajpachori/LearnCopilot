I have ReactJS EmployeeManagement web application available in the folder "C:\Programming\EmployeeMgmt\EmpReact\empreact".
JavaScript file App.js for EmployeeManagement is available in this folder "C:\Programming\EmployeeMgmt\EmpReact\empreact\src".
This web application responsible for fetching, creating, updating and deleting the employee information.

Please help writing Selenium automation program for the EmployeeManagement in JavaScript. 

For "home.spec.js", please suggest code for Search button click with id "btnSearch" after the "empIdInput" input box is populated.

For "home.spec.js", please suggest code for Delete button click with id "btnDelete" after the "btnSearch" is clicked. 

For "home.spec.js", please suggest code for Update in this sequence
1. Set the value in the input field "EmpName" to  'Tom Erichsen3U'.
2. Button click with id "btnUpdate".  

For "home.spec.js", please suggest code for Create in this sequence
1. Set the below mentioned comma separated values in curly braces for the input fields "EmpID", "EmpName", "Designation", "EmpDOJ", "ManagerName", "Compensation" and "EmpStatus".
{'12349', 'Tom Erichsen4', 'SWE24', '8/10/2021','Shiva Muralidhar4','1040004','Active4'}
2. Button click with id "btnCreate".  

In "home.spec.js", "Delete" operation is executed after "Create" operation. I get an alert with "OK" button after the record is successfully "Created ". However this alert stops "Delete" operation as I don't have script for clicking the "OK" button in the alert, after the "Create" operation. Please suggest how to handle the alert box so "Delete" operation can run smoothly after "Create" operation.
